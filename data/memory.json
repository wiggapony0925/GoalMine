      "full_analysis": "**Fatigue Score Calculation:**\n\n1. **Altitude Shock**:  \n   - Elevation gain from MetLife Stadium (elevation approximately 3m) to Azteca Stadium (elevation 2245m) is 2242m.\n   - Significant aerobic penalty due to altitude gain: 2242m / 500m = 4.48 (round to 4.5).\n\n2. **Travel Fatigue**:  \n   - Flight distance is 3373.9 km, which is greater than 2000 km.\n   - Circadian disruption factor: 2.0.\n\n3. **Heat Stress**:  \n   - Temperature is 13.6\u00b0C, which is below the threshold of 28\u00b0C.\n   - No additional performance drop due to heat stress.\n\n4. **Recent Workload**:  \n   - 1 match in the last 2 weeks indicates a moderate workload.\n\n**Total Fatigue Score**:  \n- Altitude Shock: 4.5  \n- Travel Fatigue: 2.0  \n- Heat Stress: 0  \n- Workload Adjustment: Small impact anticipated, so add 0.5\n\nTotal Fatigue Score = 4.5 + 2.0 + 0 + 0.5 = **7.0**\n\n**Strategic Advice**:  \n\"Altitude at Azteca amplifies home team advantage. Recommend acclimatization period and altitude training sessions to mitigate aerobic penalty. Minimize effects of travel fatigue by optimizing sleep schedules and recovery protocols.\""
